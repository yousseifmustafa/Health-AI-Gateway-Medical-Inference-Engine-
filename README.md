> **State-of-the-art Autonomous Medical Triage System** utilizing Adaptive RAG, Semantic Chunking, and Agentic Orchestration to deliver safe, hallucination-free diagnostic support.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Health-AI-Gateway** is not just a chatbot; it's a hierarchical **Agentic System** designed to simulate a professional medical triage process. It acts as a centralized orchestrator that intelligently routes patient queries to specialized agents (Diagnostic Doctor, Web Search, or Vision Analysis) based on intent.

The core innovation lies in its **Self-Correcting Diagnostic Loop**, where the system continuously evaluates its own confidence levels. If the confidence is below a safety threshold (0.8), it autonomously triggers a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) loop to fetch verified medical evidence from a vector database, ensuring maximum safety and accuracy.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Agentic Orchestration (The Triage Router)
The system operates on a **Star Topology**, where a central "Brain" decides the optimal tool for the job.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(("User Input")) --> Router["🧠 Triage Router (Agent)\n(Intent Classification)"]
    
    Router -- "Medical Triage" --> DoctorTool["🩺 Consult Doctor Tool\n(Diagnostic Agent)"]
    Router -- "General Info/Prices" --> WebTool["🌐 Web Search Tool\n(Tavily API)"]
    Router -- "X-Ray/Prescription" --> VisionTool["👁️ Vision Analysis Tool\n(Gemini Vision/OCR)"]
    Router -- "Emergency" --> FamilyTool["🚨 Notify Family Tool\n(Twilio/Mock SMS)"]
    
    DoctorTool --> Router
    WebTool --> Router
    VisionTool --> Router
    FamilyTool --> Router
    
    Router -- "Safe Response" --> End(("Final Output"))

```



### 2. Self-Correcting Adaptive RAG

Unlike traditional linear RAG, this system "thinks" before it speaks.

    %% 2. The Unified Generator
    Optimize --> Generate["Unified Generator Node<br/>(1st Pass: Memory | 2nd Pass: With Docs)"]
    
    %% 3. The Grading Action (Separated Node)
    Generate --> GraderNode["Grader Node<br/>(Evaluate Answer & Update State with Score)"]
    
    %% 4. The Decision Logic (Conditional Edge/Router)
    GraderNode --> Router{"Router / Decision<br/>Is Score >= 0.8?<br/>OR<br/>Has RAG Run Before?"}

    %% 5. Branching
    Router -- "✅ Yes / Safe" --> Validate
    Router -- "❌ No (Need Context)" --> Retrieve

    %% 6. The RAG Loop (Fetcher)

    %% 7. Finalization

    Summarize --> End(("End"))

🚀 Key Features
🤖 Agentic Triage Router: Uses LLM-based intent classification to dynamically dispatch tasks. It knows the difference between "I have a headache" (Doctor) and "How much is Panadol?" (Search).

🔄 Self-Correcting Loop: A specialized Judge Agent evaluates every answer. If confidence < 80%, it rejects the answer and forces the system to consult external medical references (Zilliz).

🧠 Semantic Data Engineering: Utilizing Gemma-300m for advanced Semantic Chunking during data ingestion, ensuring that retrieved context is coherent and meaningful (solved the Fabry Disease challenge).

🛡️ Safety Guardrails: A final validation layer filters output for medical safety and adapts the response tone to match the user's dialect (e.g., Egyptian Slang handling).

👁️ Multimodal Support: Can analyze medical images (X-Rays, Prescriptions) using Vision Language Models.

⚡ Resilient Infrastructure: Built on FastAPI with async architecture, Dockerized for easy deployment, and includes automated "Keep-Alive" triggers for the Vector DB.
